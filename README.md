## GA Tech Boot Camp Module 2
### Description
The script in this repository is designed to loop through stocks for a given year and outputs the following information:
* Ticker symbol
* Yearly change from opening price of that given year to the closing price at the end of the year
* The percent change from opening price of that given year to the closing price at the end of the year
* Total stock volumn of the stock

In additon to loop through the given year to calculate stocks, the script will loop through all sheets provided in the workbook. For this assignment, there were three sheets for 2018, 2019, and 2020.

The yearly change column contains conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

Images are provided to showcase the results of each year in the files that were provided. These files are not currently included in this repository.

### Bonus
As part of the bonus portion of this homework assignment, the script also identifies the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volumn and provides both the ticker symbol and value of each identifier.

### Submission Requirements
* VBA Script(s) required to analyze stock data
* Screenshots of the results for each year in the provided dataset.
